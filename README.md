Day 4 of #100daysofcodechallenge
This is my first project on github. I've just started learning python and this is my first project of the #100daysofcode challenge on udemy.
It is basically a rock, paper and scissor game in which you choose an object and computer chooses another object randomly so based on the choices of both winner is decided. Maybe this is a very basic project and not worth sharing here but i feel glad that i am learning something so passionately and with passing days I'll be posting more interesting projects here.
