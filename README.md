# 100daysofcodechallenge
Day 3 of #100daysofcodechallenge
This is my first project on github. I've just started learning python and this is my first project of the #100daysofcode challenge on udemy.
This project is basically a tip generator in which the amount of tip each person has to pay according to the % of the total bill amount they decide to pay as a tip altogether.
Maybe this is a very basic project and not worth sharing here but i feel glad that i am learning something so passionately and with passing days I'll be posting more interesting projects here.
